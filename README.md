# Voicecord
Make your discord account 24/7 online on voice channels!

----

A code written in Python that helps you to keep your account 24/7 on discord voice channels.

#### Please check out this if you want to add multiple tokens with just one file: [phantom.sellix.io/product/6359655010aec](https://phantom.sellix.io/product/6359655010aec)

The [main.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Voicecord/blob/main/main.py) is the main file. [keep_alive.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Voicecord/blob/main/keep_alive.py) prevents your repl from going to sleep. (If you have a replit hacker plan or want to run the script locally, then you can delete [this file](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Voicecord/blob/main/keep_alive.py) and paste this code inside the [main.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Voicecord/blob/main/main.py) file :

    ws.send(json.dumps(vc))
    time.sleep(heartbeat / 1000)
